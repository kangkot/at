"You aren't gonna need it" (acronym: YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.[4] XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."[5] Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" and "You ain't gonna need it".[citation needed]
